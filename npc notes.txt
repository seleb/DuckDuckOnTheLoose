mountain climber:
Wow duck duck! You climbed this mountain too?
Isn't it great up here? So far up...
So far away from everything...
...
It was quite a hike!
One slip and that would've been it for me!
...
I hope we'll have a safe trip back to base camp.
Wouldn't want them to send a rescue team after us!
...
*sigh*
I know, duck duck. I know it's all flat.
But let me have this moment, ok?
Thanks duck duck.
REPEAT I think I can see my house from here!

Haha!|My friends think I'm crazy for doing this.|They say it's dangerous to be out here alone.|They keep telling me but I just ignore them.|It's like water off a duck's back!|Haha!|Thanks for the visit...|But I should get back to excercising.|See you around duck duck!|

ghost:

I'm supposed to be scary, not funny!
Who ever heard of a ghost that makes you laugh?
It's ridiculous!
Hmph!

Crater man:
Duck duck?! You shouldn't be out here!
It's really dangerous!
You aren't wearing protective gear or anything!
Ohhh - if my supervisor sees you they're gonna throw a fit.
Look, you need to get a move on.
This is no place for a duck!
~Especially~ not duck duck!
Oh man I'm going to be in sooo much trouble...


Ranger:
Hoi duck duck!
What's the news from the lake?
Anything to report?
It's been pretty quiet in these parts.
Couple canine ruffians came through earlier...
Nothing we can't handle though!

Keep up the good work duck duck!
